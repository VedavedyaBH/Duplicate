How it works?

*This program is writteen in c.
*Create a text file containing the data i.e numbers(include duplicate numbers).
*Place this text file in the root file.
*Compile the given code and execute. 
*It asks for the name of the file to be read. Give the name of the file you just created.
*If there is a duplicate in that file , it displays it. Else it exits automatically. 



Illustration

Name of the text file is "c.txt"

(After executing)
Enter the name of the file to e read
c.txt
The duplicate item is 3.
